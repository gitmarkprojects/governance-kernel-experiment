AI and code are underleveraged for coordination between agents. this repo experiments with solving that.

goal is:
- develop a general communication protocol to coordinate collective, value aligned action in a multi agent system
- integrate existing ideas about better voting systems (quadratic voting, liquid democracy, lucid democracy etc.)
- package it into a generalized, practical framework and platform

work in progress, starting march 2025.
